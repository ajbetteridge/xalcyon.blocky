If you are a Windows user, unzip the XALCYON-WIN32.ZIP file and look
for XALCYON.EXE in the resulting folder. You may also need to edit
BLOCKY-INIT.LISP to set up your joystick buttons/axes. (Sorry, I will
have a proper button config screen soon.)

Linux users: The file XALCYON.APP is the 32-bit GNU/Linux executable
program. You will need to have installed the SDL libraries.  Please
see the [[https://github.com/dto/blocky/blob/master/INSTALL][installation instructions]] for Blocky, and also
[[https://github.com/dto/blocky/blob/master/blocky-init.lisp][blocky-init.lisp]] for info on how to configure the joystick.

* About 

XALCYON is a challenging multidirectional PC shooting game with dual
analog stick control and procedurally generated levels. XALCYON is the
sequel to [[http://dto.github.com/notebook/xong.html][XONG]], and exhibits the same 80s-home-computer-game
audiovisual aesthetic that I employed in XONG.

XALCYON requires a USB or other game controller with dual analog
sticks and at least three buttons. The player uses the analog sticks
to independently control both movement and aiming/firing of his robot
as it fights through a series of increasingly difficult levels.  These
maps are randomly generated from a library of templates specifying
different terrain and enemy combinations. Once all enemies on a level
are destroyed, the gateway to the next level will appear.

As in XONG, one single hit from any bullet or enemy or explosion will
kill you and completely end the current game. However, you can simply
hit ESCAPE to generate a fresh scenario starting from level 1. Sudden
permadeath increases tension, but characters are quite disposable, so
it becomes a score challenge.

Your robot can hold and use one item at a time. The player starts the
game with a shield which blocks bullets coming from the direction the
right stick is aiming. The shield (or other item) can be activated by
pressing L1 or L2. Items are found in boxes, or left behind by smashed
enemies.

The main gun is always equipped, and can be fired by pressing or
holding R1 or R2. However, both shield and gun must consume energy to
operate. Your robot has a limited energy supply, and the gauge will
run out quickly if you use the shield for a long period (even faster
if you are also shooting the main gun.) When energy is too low, you
will not be able to use guns or shields for a few moments, and will be
highly vulnerable while you wait for it to recharge.

The player can equip a bomb instead of the shield; these explode a few
seconds after being fired, and they stick to enemies and walls. But
there are enemies that can fire bombs at you too.

"Monitors" are orange robotic drones that patrol the fortress, firing
a spread of bullets before dashing away from the player. Highly
dangerous in groups. They turn red when they're badly damaged.

* Level gen Notes

<dto> im working on finally cracking my issues with level generation,
      i.e. things colliding or being off the map 
<dto> the solution has presented itself. i'm going to use my new quadtree code
      to allow generating pieces of a level in a "void" and then generating a
      bounding-box for them , i can process collisions at that point to make
      sure the level is kosher before pasting it into a larger level in its
      own area and then doing that for the other level pieces until you
      calculate the bounding box for the whole level dynamically and then just
      build a proper
<dto> quadtree automatically. i can even detect areas of buildup and possibly
      re-grid once or twice

* Design doc (outdated)

MicroXONG is a retro-remake of [[http://dto.github.com/notebook/xong.html][XONG]] with graphics, sound, and controls
similar to those of an Intellivison or Atari 5200 game from the bygone
era of 8-bit games, but with OpenGL transparency and scaling added to
the mix. 

You are a vulnerable white square that can move only in the four
cardinal directions (using the arrow keys, numpad, or gamepad). Using
the spacebar (or joystick button) you can fire a bullet in the
direction you last moved. (This direction is indicated by a little dot
on the player's sprite.) 

One hit kills you, and completely ends your game---to win at MicroXONG
you must reach the end without taking a single bullet from an enemy or
touching a single hot zone. A successful game of SuperXONG should be
able to be completed in less than 20 minutes. Player lives are
disposable, and pressing ESCAPE after death will instantly begin a new
game.

You must infiltrate an enemy research facility with four increasingly
difficult levels. Each level is semi-randomly generated as in a
roguelike, but levels are not entirely grid-based. Your goal is to
defeat all enemies, retrieve one or more encrypted data files, and
transmit them back to your home base at a terminal located somewhere
on each level. Each transmission results in a random bit of story
being shown to the player in the form of a fictional email, and a
story could be sketched in this way with a small library of these
emails.

Your character is trailed by a positronic filament "tail" (represented
by a yellow line following your square) which can destroy bullets and
certain other moving objects. By sweeping the filament across the path
of an oncoming particle or bullet, you can annihilate them and reduce
the danger level. The tail is not overly long (this would make the
game too easy) and cannot be extended.

An energy meter is shown at the bottom corner of the game window as a
segmented horizontal bar with an E next to it. Energy is required to
fire your bullets, and when your energy is too low, the tail shield
will not function and you will be more vulnerable.

You can regain energy by grabbing an "E" powerup (these should be
somewhat scarce) or by absorbing particles with your tail.

Your bullets bounce back and forth along a line (either horizontal or
vertical.) You can catch your own bullets, which restores an
equivalent amount of energy. So part of the strategy will be in
destroying colorful blocks and/or objects in paddle-and-brick-game
fashion.

Your bullets don't directly kill enemies---instead you must trigger
bombs when they pass by, or direct the enemies into incinerators.

There are forcefield doors between some rooms that open when shot with
a bullet, and close after a few seconds. Colliding with the forcefield
kills you.

Player speed should be 1 pixel when shift is held (use in danger areas.)

** Difficulty A/B
